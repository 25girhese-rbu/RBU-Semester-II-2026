# Data Structures: 0th Practical (Bridge Course)

This folder contains the foundational C programming assignments for Semester II at Ramdeobaba University. The course serves as a bridge between basic logic and advanced Data Structures.

## 📁 File Structure & Contents

- **Basic_Logic.c**: Basic arithmetic, conditional checks (positive/negative/largest), loops (1-10), and recursive factorial logic.
- **Array_Pointer_Basics.c**: Array traversal, sum of elements, and demonstration of pointer-based swapping.
- **Student_Management.c**: Basic record management using `struct` for student data.
- **Hospital_Management.c**: A comprehensive, menu-driven system using `struct` to manage patient records (Add, Search, Display, Update).
- **DS_BridgeCourse_Report_Soniya_Girhe.pdf**: Official lab report including problem statements and output screenshots.

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes
- **Modularity**: Organizing code into separate specialized files.
- **Pointers**: Direct memory manipulation and call-by-reference.
- **Data Modeling**: Using Structures to handle real-world entities like patients and students.
